# Getting started with Windows drivers


Start here to learn fundamental concepts about drivers.

You should already be familiar with the [C programming language](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?LinkID=317477), and you should understand the ideas of function pointers, callback functions, and event handlers. If you are going to write a driver based on User-Mode Driver Framework 1.x, you should be familiar with [C++ and COM](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p?LinkID=317460).
